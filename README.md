# Titanic_LogisticRegression_inR
Using R, I used glm from the MASS library to instantiate a model to perform categorical prediction analysis of two outcomes via logistic regression. The two outcomes are lived and died, and they indicate whether passengers from the Titanic survived or not. That data is then used to predict the outcome of survival, where if my siblings, my parents, and myself were aboard the Titanic.
